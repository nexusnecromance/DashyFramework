# Welcome to the Dashy Framework Github repository
Dashy framework is a mixture of libraries and tools created for [Playdate](https://play.date), a handheld game system with a crank, to ease development for Platformers in general. However, more than anything, it aims to deliver the essence of high-speed, momentum-based platforming games to the tiny yellow machine.

## Our goal involves developing, implementing, and optimizing the following:
- Sensor-based terrain collision detection, with rotation.
- Efficient level loading, being able to save large levels in RAM at a time.
- Seamless transitions between levels.
- lowering loading time as much as possible.
- Solid 30FPS on device from start to finish for both hardware revisions, minimum.
- Testing quicker methods for computationally-expensive mathematical functions.
- Developing a piece of software that focuses on level design, codenamed "Horizon".
- Developing a solution to music production, codenamed "Bliss".

## Games that use it:
- [Sonic 1 Playdate Deluxe](https://discord.com/channels/675983554655551509/1142444824201535589)
