# Welcome to the Dashy Framework Github repository
This Github repository aims to deliver the core of Classic Sonic The Hedgehog games for Playdate.

## Our goal involves the following:
- Sensor-based terrain collision detection, with rotation.
- Efficient level loading, being able to save large levels in RAM at a time.


It will be used to develop Sonic 1 Playdate Deluxe, A Fan-made port of Sonic 1 (1991) for Playdate, with extras.
