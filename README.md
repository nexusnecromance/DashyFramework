# Welcome to the Dashy Framework Github repository
This project aims to deliver the core of high-speed, momentum-based platforming, akin to the classic Sonic The Hedgehog games, to [Playdate](https://play.date), a handheld video game device.

## Our goal involves developing, implementing, and optimizing the following:
- Sensor-based terrain collision detection, with rotation.
- Efficient level loading, being able to save large levels in RAM at a time.
- Solid 30FPS on device from start to finish.

## Games that use it:
- [Sonic 1 Playdate Deluxe](https://discord.com/channels/675983554655551509/1142444824201535589)
